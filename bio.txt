Analytics for a Better World, Sept 2022

Wildlife poaching fuels the multi-billion dollar illegal wildlife trade and pushes countless species to the brink of extinction. To aid rangers in preventing poaching in protected areas around the world, we have developed PAWS, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security. We present technical advances in multi-armed bandits and robust sequential decision-making using reinforcement learning, with research questions that emerged from on-the-ground challenges. We also discuss bridging the gap between research and practice, presenting results from field tests in Cambodia and large-scale deployment through integration with SMART, the leading software system for protected area management used by over 1,000 wildlife parks worldwide.

-----------------


To prevent poaching, rangers conduct patrols around these protected areas to detect and confiscate snares. Unfortunately, poachers have the upper hand; wire snares are extremely cheap to make and easy to carry, so poachers can easily blanket the ground with snares

Profit-driven poachers will enter protected areas and place snares to entrap animals. 

Our project is called PAWS, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security, which has been created in close partnership with a number of conservation organizations, including the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)

Although SMART records significant amounts of historical data, its current capabilities are limited to managing data; the missing link is to leverage that data to inform patrol strategy

In collaboration with conservation NGOs, our project helps plan effective ranger patrols to protect endangered animals from poaching. Algorithmically, the problem is to optimize limited resources to maximize the number of snares confiscated.

Talk title: Conserving the Most Vulnerable Wildlife: Ranked Prioritization of Groups with Combinatorial Bandits

Abstract: Wildlife poaching fuels the multi-billion dollar illegal wildlife trade and pushes countless species to the brink of extinction. To aid rangers in preventing poaching in protected areas around the world, we develop an multi-armed bandit approach to help rangers choose how much time to spend in each region, balancing exploration of infrequently visited regions and exploitation of known hotspots. However, naive bandit approaches compromise short-term performance for long-term optimality, resulting in animals poached. To speed up performance, we leverage smoothness in the reward function and decomposability of actions. Additionally, when some species are more vulnerable, we ought to offer more protection to these animals; unfortunately, existing bandit approaches do not offer a way to prioritize important species. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel combinatorial bandit objective that trades off between reward maximization and species prioritization. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on real-world poaching data from Cambodia.

Talk title: Minimax Regret Optimization: Robust Planning for Conservation and Maternal Health

Abstract: Sequential decision-making algorithms, including reinforcement learning, have been applied to a wide variety of settings including planning ranger patrols for wildlife conservation and scheduling interventions for maternal healthcare. Unfortunately, in these real-world settings, we rarely have a perfect simulator of the environment, which is necessary for planning. Thus, we consider robust planning by formulating the problem as a game between the planner and an adversarial nature, who sets worst-case instantiations of environment parameters, to optimize for minimax regret for the planner. We present theoretical convergence results as well as concrete applications to deployed research, using reinforcement learning for wildlife conservation in Cambodia and restless bandits for maternal healthcare in India.

Title: Online Learning and Robust Planning: Restless Bandits for Maternal Health Interventions


Online Learning for Restless Bandits: Scheduling Interventions for Maternal Health

Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) extend multi-armed bandits to allow for stateful arms, where the state of each arm evolves restlessly depending on whether that arm is pulled. RMABs have been applied to critical sequential decision-making problems including scheduling health interventions. However, solving RMABs requires knowing transition dynamics, which are often unknown upfront, particularly in healthcare applications. Here, we propose the first online learning algorithm based on the Whittle index policy, using an upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. Specifically, we estimate confidence bounds of the unknown transition probabilities and formulate a bilinear program to compute optimistic Whittle indices. Our algorithm, UCWhittle, achieves sublinear O(H √ T log T) frequentist regret in T episodes with a constant horizon H. Empirically, we demonstrate that UCWhittle achieves improved performance on a real maternal and childcare dataset from an NGO in India.
