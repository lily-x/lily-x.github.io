                    I am a PhD student in computer science at Harvard University, advised by <a href="https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe">Prof. Milind Tambe</a>.

                    My research focuses on developing AI methods across machine learning, sequential decision-making, and optimization for planetary health, particularly to address environmental challenges such as biodiversity conservation. 
<!--                    Specifically, I develop approaches in online learning and reinforcement learning to overcome sparse data, uncertainty, and multi-step decision settings pervasive in conservation management.-->

                    <!-- I am passionate about reducing my negative impact on the environment and increasing my positive impact on society. -->
                </p>

                <p>
                    I co-organize the <strong><a href="http://md4sg.com/">Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)</a></strong> research initiative, which advances computational techniques to improve access to opportunity for historically marginalized communities.
                    Additionally, I serve as AI Lead for the <strong><a href="https://smartconservationtools.org/">SMART Partnership</a></strong>, where I help build computational and research solutions for effective conservation management.
